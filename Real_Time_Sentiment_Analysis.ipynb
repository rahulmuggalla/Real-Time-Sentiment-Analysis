        "The main purpose of sentiment analysis is to analyze the opinions of users of a particular product or service, which helps customers understand the quality of the product. For example, every time Apple releases a new iPhone, we see a lot of people giving their opinion on it, some like it and some criticize it, in the end, all people’s opinions help us decide whether we should buy the new iPhone or not.\n",

Now, what if you want to analyze people’s feelings in real-time, i.e. ask a user about your product and understand your product in real-time. In the section below, I’ll walk you through a simple way of real-time sentiment analysis using Python.\n",

So for this real-time sentiment analysis task using Python, I will be using the NLTK library in Python which is a very useful tool for all the tasks of natural language processing. So let’s import the NLTK library and start with sentiment analysis:"
